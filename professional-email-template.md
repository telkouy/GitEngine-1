# Professional Email Template - Vibe Coder Role Follow-up

## Subject: Quick follow-up on our Vibe Coder conversation

Hi there!

Hope you're doing well! I wanted to follow up on our conversation about the Vibe Coder role at Force of Nature.

Your approach to rapid AI-powered development really resonated with me, so I decided to put it into practice. I built a developer productivity dashboard using the exact workflow we discussed - AI-assisted prototyping on Replit with modern tools.

**Live demo**: https://pisanocamivibing.replit.app

The project showcases real-time data visualization, AI insights, and WebSocket connections - all implemented in under 24 hours using the "vibe coder" methodology. It's a practical demonstration of rapid iteration and user-focused development.

I'm genuinely excited about the possibility of bringing this approach to Force of Nature, though I'm also exploring other opportunities to find the right fit for this next chapter.

Would love to chat about how this development philosophy could accelerate your product goals!

Best regards,
[Your Name]

P.S. - The codebase is fully documented if you'd like to explore the technical implementation.
