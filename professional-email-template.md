## Subject: Quick follow-up on our conversation

Hey!

Hope you're doing well! Quick personal update first - I officially wrapped up at my previous job today and I'm super excited about this next chapter. Been thinking a lot about our conversation regarding rapid development and honestly, it got me pretty inspired.

So... I might have gone a bit overboard and built something to show what I meant about fast iteration with AI tools. Check this out: https://pisanocamivibing.replit.app

It's basically a developer productivity dashboard that I put together using the exact approach we discussed - AI-assisted development but with actual strategy behind it. The whole thing has real-time updates, interactive charts, modern UI, and it's fully functional. Built it in under 24 hours which I think proves the point about rapid prototyping.

What's cool is it demonstrates the balance we talked about - using AI to move fast without sacrificing quality. The architecture is production-ready, TypeScript throughout, proper state management, WebSocket connections working, the whole nine yards.

I'm genuinely excited about the possibility of bringing this kind of approach to your team. At the same time, I want to be upfront that I'm exploring a few different opportunities to make sure I find the right fit for this career pivot.

The rapid development philosophy really clicks with me, and I think this little project shows how it could work in practice for building actual products.

Would love to chat more about it if you're interested!

Best,
[Your Name]

P.S. - The whole codebase is there if you want to poke around and see how it's built.
